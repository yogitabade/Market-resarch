The affordability and accessibility of treatments in clinics make them an attractive option for individuals who wish to manage their condition without the need for hospitalization. Furthermore, clinics often have shorter wait times for consultations and treatments, which contributes to their growing popularity in the market. The increasing focus on aesthetic dermatology also drives the demand for facial erythema therapies in clinics, creating significant market opportunities for providers.<p>Other healthcare settings, which encompass a variety of facilities such as spas, wellness centers, and home-care services, are also seeing a rise in the provision of facial erythema therapies.
