The popularity of ancient grains in this category stems from their ability to enhance the nutritional content of traditional baked items without compromising taste and texture. For example, spelt flour and quinoa flour are often used as healthier alternatives to refined wheat flour.

Ancient grains are often incorporated into snack bars, granola, chocolate, and other confectionery items to increase the nutritional value of these products. Teff and quinoa are particularly popular for use in the creation of healthier snack bars, as they provide a rich source of protein, fiber, and minerals, while also offering a unique flavor profile. This has become a key selling point for health-conscious consumers who still desire indulgence but want to avoid processed ingredients and excess sugars commonly found in conventional confectionery products.<p>Additionally, the incorporation of ancient grains in confectionery is driven by the increasing demand for clean label products. Consumers are looking for products with fewer artificial additives and preservatives, and ancient grains are seen as a natural and wholesome ingredient that can help meet this demand.

Ancient grains like quinoa, amaranth, and teff are being used in energy bars, protein shakes, and meal replacements. These grains are not only a great source of protein but also contain essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals that support overall health and muscle recovery. The demand for these nutrient-dense grains in the sports nutrition market is being fueled by the growing awareness of their benefits among athletes and health-conscious individuals.<p>The trend towards plant-based and functional foods within the sports nutrition industry further supports the adoption of ancient grains. As more consumers shift towards plant-based diets, there is an increasing interest in protein alternatives derived from ancient grains rather than animal-based sources. Ancient grains offer a viable solution for those seeking plant-based nutrition that meets the demands of their active lifestyle. As this trend continues, manufacturers are expected to expand their product offerings to include a wider variety of ancient grain-based sports nutrition products, which will further drive the growth of this subsegment.</p><h2>Infant Formula</h2><p>Ancient grains are also finding their way into the infant formula market, where they are valued for their natural, nutrient-rich properties.

Quinoa, in particular, is increasingly being incorporated into organic and premium infant formulas due to its complete amino acid profile and digestibility. Parents are increasingly seeking formulas made with natural and non-GMO ingredients, making ancient grain-based formulas an attractive choice in the marketplace.<p>The use of ancient grains in infant formula also aligns with the growing trend toward clean label products. As awareness around food sourcing and ingredient transparency rises, many parents prefer formulas that are free from artificial additives and preservatives. The inclusion of ancient grains helps address these concerns while ensuring that the product is nutritionally balanced. The market for ancient grain-based infant formulas is expected to grow as more manufacturers incorporate these grains into their products to meet the demands of health-conscious parents looking for more natural options for their children.</p><h2>Cereals</h2><p>Ancient grains are being incorporated into breakfast cereals as consumers increasingly seek nutritious, whole-grain options to start their day. Cereals made with grains like quinoa, spelt, and farro provide a rich source of fiber, protein, and micronutrients, making them an appealing choice for health-conscious individuals. The incorporation of ancient grains in cereals helps to cater to a broad audience, including those seeking gluten-free, high-protein, or organic options. As a result, this subsegment has seen significant growth, with major cereal brands introducing ancient grain-based lines to capture the growing consumer interest in healthy and functional breakfast foods.<p>In addition, the rise of low-sugar and high-protein breakfast options has contributed to the growth of ancient grain-based cereals.
