The treatment landscape for patients below 65 years is characterized by a higher rate of acceptance of new treatments and better tolerance to chemotherapy drugs like cabazitaxel. This age group is more likely to be diagnosed at earlier stages of prostate cancer, which may result in their receiving treatments such as cabazitaxel after they have developed resistance to hormonal therapies. Additionally, patients below 65 years typically have a greater ability to withstand the side effects of chemotherapy, such as fatigue, nausea, and bone marrow suppression, which are common with cabazitaxel administration. Therefore, the demand for cabazitaxel within this subsegment is expected to see steady growth, driven by both the increasing prevalence of prostate cancer and the growing adoption of novel cancer therapies in the region.<p>The application of cabazitaxel in patients aged above 65 years presents distinct challenges and opportunities. Older patients are generally more vulnerable to chemotherapy’s adverse effects due to factors like diminished organ function, coexisting health conditions, and a reduced ability to tolerate aggressive cancer treatments. However, cabazitaxel remains an essential option for this demographic, particularly for those with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have exhausted other therapies. The treatment protocol for this age group may involve dose adjustments and close monitoring, which increases the complexity of care but ensures that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Moreover, with aging populations in countries such as Japan and China, the market for cabazitaxel in patients above 65 years is anticipated to grow steadily, influenced by both the increasing incidence of prostate cancer and advancements in geriatric oncology care that allow older patients to better tolerate the drug’s side effects.</p><h3>Key Trends in the Asia–Pacific Cabazitaxel Market</h3><p>The Asia–Pacific Cabazitaxel Market is witnessing several key trends, including the growing demand for targeted therapies and precision medicine.
